# Operating-Systems
This repository contains code examples of fundamental topics in Operating Systems as taught in a course of the same name for a Computer Engineering class at Federal University of Amazonas(Brazil). It covers Virtualization, Persistence, and Concurrence.

This is an ongoing project. Most of the material posted here can be found in other sources as well. The solutions here presented are mostly implemented in C, with some C++ and Python. As the work flows, some of it will be ported to RUST language.
